## [Our services](https://www.osayawe.com/services)

We have a [team](https://www.osayawe.com/about) of capable, multi-talented contributors who are passionate about software development and design, delivering nothing but the best. We believe that everyone should play to their strengths. Our diverse team does just that across many disciplines, ranging from software engineering, design, marketing, project management and the arts.

Software development is a complex process involving product development, design and engineering. We greatly reduce this complexity by centralizing the talent and process needed to bring a product from kick-off to completion.

## Our 4-step process:

1.  Discovery, Scope & Strategy
2.  Design & Prototyping
3.  Development
4.  Launch & Maintenance

By implementing this four-step process, we can ensure that we remain true to the client's vision by asking the right questions, providing high fidelity prototypes, setting up test and staging environments and providing assistance every step of the way.

[Our expertise](https://www.osayawe.com/about) is deep, diverse and above all, rare. We deliver scalable, production-grade software that is the result of industry best practices such as test-driven development and the [12 factor methodology](https://12factor.net).


## Work With Us

At [Osayawe](https://www.osayawe.com), everyone is an independent contributor in-charge of their own work and schedule. Each member of our team draws their weekly goals from our global backlog and sees them to completion, collaborating with other team members to deliver comprehensive results.

If you're goal-oriented like us, enjoy your artistic freedom and have strong but loosely held opinions-- then this may be the sign you've been looking for. [Contact us](mailto:contact@osayawe.com) for more information on how you can be a part of [Osayawe](https://www.osayawe.com).
